# Math-Magicians

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

This add-hooks branch was created to achieve the following:
- Refactor the Calculator component (`components/Calculator.js`) from a class based component to a functional component with *hooks*.
- After the refactor is done, test the app in the browser. It should keep the same functionality.
