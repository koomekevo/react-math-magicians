# Math-Magicians

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

This add-events-handlers branch was created to achieve the following:
- Copy  the files `calculate.js` and `operate.js` into a `logic/` directory in your project.
- Analyze the files `calculate.js` and `operate.js`, be sure you understand what they do.
- Import the files in your Calculator component.
- Implement the event handlers you need to use the math logic from `calculate.js` and `operate.js` in your React component.
- Practice what you have learned until now: use `state` and `props`, pass props to *child* components, use lifecycle methods, *lift state up*.
- Test your app in the browser. It should be able to perform math operations.
