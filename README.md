# Math-Magicians

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

This add-components branch was created to achieve the following:
- Delete all the boilerplate from CRA (text, images, styles).	
- Create a directory called components.	
- Inside components, create a new Calculator.js file.	
- In Calculator.js, create a React component that matches the design.	
- Don't add any extra design.	
- Develop just the UI of the calculator; the math logic to make it work will be added in next       project.	
- Use class based components.
